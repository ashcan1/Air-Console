# Air-Console
-There is only one airplane. The airplane has 40 seats. There are 8
rows. There are 5 seats on each row. Denominated seat A-E. The seat
number is a combination of the row number and the seat letter.
– There are 2 seat classes. Rows 1 to 5 are business class rows. The
remaining number of rows are Economy class.
– All user input must be validated
– All passenger details are saved in a flight manifest file and loaded next
time the application is started
– This is a single console application. So thread safety and
concurrent access is not an issue
